\section{Introduction}
This document specifies the 'Coordinated Hydra Head' protocol to be implemented as the first version of Hydra Head on Cardano - \textbf{Hydra HeadV1}. The protocol is derived from variants described in the original paper \cite{hydrahead20}, but further simplified to allow for easier implementation.

TODO: The security analysis is still \textbf{sketchy}, with the goal to make it more formal in upcoming
iterations.

\subsection{Overview}
In the coordinated-head protocol, off-chain consensus is simplified by not having transactions
confirmed concurrently to the snapshots (and to each other) but having the snapshot leader propose,
in their snapshot, a set of transactions for explicit confirmation. The parties' views of confirmed
transactions thus progress in sync with each other (once per confirmed snapshot), thus simplifying
the close/contest procedure on the main-chain. Also, there is no need for conflict resolution as
in Appendix~B of~\cite{hydrahead20}.

TODO: Use similar (shortened) introduction as in \cite{hydrahead20}
