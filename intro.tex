\section{Introduction}
This document specifies the 'Coordinated Hydra Head' protocol to be implemented as the first version of Hydra Head on Cardano - \textbf{Hydra HeadV1}. The protocol is derived from variants described in the original paper \cite{hydrahead20}, but was further simplified to make a first implementation on Cardano possible.

The specification is structured similarly as the original paper, but focuses on a single variant, and avoids indirections and unnecessary generalizations. First, a high-level overview of the protocol and how it differs from legacy variants of the Head protocol is given in Section~\ref{sec:overview}. Relevant definitions and notations are introduced in Section~\ref{sec:prel}, while Section~\ref{sec:setup} describes protocol setup and assumptions. Then, the actual on-chain transactions of the protocol are defined in Section~\ref{sec:on-chain}, before the off-chain protocol part specifies behavior of Hydra parties off-chain and ties the knot with on-chain transactions in Section~\ref{sec:offchain}. \todo{Add: network specification (message formats)} At last, Section~\ref{sec:security} gives the security definition, properties and proofs for the Coordinated Head protocol.
\todo{The security analysis is still \textbf{sketchy}, with the goal to make it more formal in upcoming iterations}
