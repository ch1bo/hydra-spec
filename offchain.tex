Variables:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}\hline
  $\hats$  & Sequence number of seen snapshot. \\ \hline
  $\bars$  & Sequence number of confirmed snapshot. \\ \hline
  $\hatmU$ & Seen snapshot object. \\ \hline
  $\barmU$ & Confirmed snapshot object. \\ \hline
  $\hatmL$ & Local ledger extension using seen transactions to prepare the next snapshot.\\ \hline
  $\mT$    & Set of all transactions ever received via reqTx (independent of their validity or mutual conflicts).\\  \hline
  $\hatmT$ & Set of transactions that extend the $\barmU$ (or $\hatmU$\todo{??}) to form $\hatmL$. \\
           & Transaction candidates that go into the next snapshot (if this party is the next leader).\\ \hline
  $\barmT$ & Set of all confirmed transactions up to the latest confirmed snapshot.\\  \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

In particular, note, that the original variables $\hatmT$ and $\barmT$ are not required anymore because they
were used in context of hanging transactions. We thus reused them to fit the new context.

Comments: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Fix: from client or from network: same function called twice should trigger at most one wait.
  For instance, $\hpRS$ called twice must not queue the 'wait' part for multiple execution.
\item Fix: $\hpNS$ called twice must not trigger local $\hpRS$ twice.
\item Add: garbage collection ($\hatmT,\barmT$,etc.)
\item Extensive code explanation (per line of code)
\end{itemize}

The following figure visualizes the possible event flows from the view of a single party.
