\section{Off-Chain Protocol}

We sate the coordinated off-chain protocol in Figure~\ref{fig:head_coordinated}.
Note the following deviations of the original protocol in~\cite{hydrahead20}.

\begin{itemize}
\item No hanging transactions due to `coordination'.
\item No acknowledgement nor confirmation of transactions.
\item No confirmation of snapshots (two-round confirmation by local acknowledgement).
\end{itemize}

Variables:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}\hline
  $\hats$  & Sequence number of latest (possibly unconfirmed) snapshot. \\ \hline
  $\bars$  & Sequence number of latest confirmed snapshot. \\ \hline
  $\hatmU$ & Latest (possibly unconfirmed) snapshot object. \\ \hline
  $\barmU$ & Latest confirmed snapshot object. \\ \hline
  $\hatmL$ & Local ledger extension by next leader. Only the next leader
  makes use of this variable.\\ \hline
  $\mT$    & Set of all received transactions (independent of their validity).\\  \hline
  $\hatmT$ & Transactions that extend the next leader's $\barmU$ (or $\hatmU$) to form $\hatmL$.\\
           & Only the next leader makes use of this variable.\\  \hline
  $\barmT$ & Set of all confirmed transactions up to the latest confirmed snapshot.\\  \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

In particular, note, that the original variables $\hatmT$ and $\barmT$ are not required anymore because they
were used in context of hanging transactions. We thus reused them to fit the new context.

Comments: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Fix: from client or from network: same function called twice should trigger at most one wait.
  For instance, $\hpRS$ called twice must not queue the 'wait' part for multiple execution.
\item Fix: $\hpNS$ called twice must not trigger local $\hpRS$ twice.
\item Fix: Concurrency resolution (reqSn stack) for snapshots (see state diagram in \cite{hydraspec22}).
\item Add: garbage collection ($\hatmT,\barmT$,etc.)
\item Extensive code explanation (per line of code)
\end{itemize}

The following figure visualizes the possible event flows from the view of a single party.
