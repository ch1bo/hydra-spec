\section{Preliminaries}\label{sec:prel}

This section introduces notation and other preliminaries used in the remainder
of the specification.

\subsection{Notation}

The specification uses set-notation based approach while also inspired
by~\cite{eutxo-2}~and~\cite{eutxo}. Values $a$ are in a set $a \in \mathcal{A}$,
also indicated as being of some type $a : \mathcal{A}$, and multidimensional values are
tuples drawn from a $\times$ product of multiple sets, e.g.
$(a,b) \in (\mathcal{A} \times \mathcal{B})$. An empty set is indicated by
$\emptyset$ and sets may be enumerated using $\{a_1 \dots a_n\}$ notation. The $=$ operator means
equality and $\gets$ is explicit assignment of a variable or value to one
or more variables. Projection is used to access the elements of a tuple, e.g.
${(a,b)}^{\downarrow1} = a$. Functions are morphisms mapping from one set to another
$x : \mathcal{A} \to f(x) : \mathcal{B}$, where function
application of a function $f$ to an argument $x$ is written as $f(x)$. \\

\noindent Furthermore, given a set $\mathcal{A}$, let
\begin{itemize}
	\item $\mathcal{A}^0 = \mathcal{A} \cup \emptyset$,
	\item $\mathcal{A}^n$ be the set of all n-sized sequences over $\mathcal{A}$,
	\item $\mathcal{A}^! = \bigcup_{i=1}^{n \in \tyNatural} \mathcal{A}^{i}$ be the set of non-empty sequences over $\mathcal{A}$, and
	\item $\mathcal{A}^* = \bigcup_{i=0}^{n \in \tyNatural} \mathcal{A}^{i}$ be
	      the set of all sequences over $\mathcal{A}$.
\end{itemize}

% \noindent The naming convention for variables is as follows: when $x$ is a single value,
% \begin{itemize}
%   \item $x'$ is a modified value (but from same set / type),
%   \item $\tilde{x}$ is an aggregated value,
%   \item $x^{\#}$ is the result of $\hash(x)$, and
%   \item $\underline{x}$ is list of values.
% \end{itemize}

\noindent With this, we further define:
\begin{itemize}
	\item $\tyBool = \{\false, \true\}$ are boolean values
	\item $\tyNatural$ are natural numbers $\{0, 1, 2, \ldots\}$
	\item $\tyInteger$ are integer numbers $\{\ldots, −2, −1, 0, 1, 2, \ldots\}$
	\item $\tyBytes = \bigcup_{n=0}^{\inf}{\{0,1\}}^{8n}$ denotes a arbitrary
	      string of bytes
	\item $\concat : \tyBytes^* \to \tyBytes$ is concatenating bytes, we also use operator $\bigoplus$ for this
	\item $\hash : x \to \tyBytes$ denotes a collision-resistant
	      hashing function and $x^{\#}$ indicates the hash of $x$
	\item $\bytes : x \to \tyBytes$ denotes an invertible serialisation function
	      mapping arbitrary data to bytes
	\item Lists of values $l \in \mathcal{A}^{*}$ are written as
	      $l = [x_{1}, \ldots, x_{n}]$. Empty lists are denoted by $[]$, the $i$th
	      element $x_{i}$ is also written $l[i]$ and the length of the list is
	      $|l| = n$. An underscore is also used to indicate al ist of values
	      $\underline{x} = l$. Projection on lists are mapped to their elements,
	      i.e.
	      $\underline{x}^{\downarrow1} = [x_{1}^{\downarrow1}, \dots, x_{n}^{\downarrow1}]$.
	\item $\sortOn : i \to \mathcal{A}^{*} \to \mathcal{A}^{*}$ does sort a list of
	      values on the $i$th projection.
	\item $\tyData$ is a universal data type of nested sums and products built up
	      recursively from the base types of $\tyInteger$ and $\tyBytes$.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Public key multi-signature scheme}\label{sec:multisig}

\noindent A multisignature scheme is a set of algorithms where
\begin{itemize}
	\item $\msSetup$ generates public parameters $\msParams$, such that
	\item $(\msVK,\msSK) \gets \msKeyGen(\msParams)$ can be used to generate fresh
	      key pairs,
	\item $\msSig \gets \msSign(\msParams,\msSK,\msMsg)$ signs a message $\msMsg$
	      using key $\msSK$,
	\item $\msCSig \gets \msComb(\msParams,\msMsg,\msVKL,\msSigL)$ aggregates a
	      list $\msSigL$ \todo{rather use $\underline{\sigma}$} of signatures of $m$ into a single, aggregate
	      signature~$\msCSig$.
	\item $\msCVK \gets \msCombVK(\msParams,\msVKL)$ aggregates a tuple $\msVKL$
	      of verification keys into a single, aggregate key $\msCVK$,
	\item $\msVfy(\msParams,\msCVK,\msMsg,\msCSig) \in \tyBool$ verifies an aggregate
	      signature $\msCSig$ of message $\msMsg$ under an aggregate verification
	      key $\msCVK$.
\end{itemize}

The security definition of a multisignature scheme
from~\cite{itakura1983public,CCS:MicOhtRey01} guarantees that, if $\msCVK$ is
produced from a tuple of verification keys $\msVKL$ via $\msCombVK$, then no
aggregate signature $\msCSig$ can pass verification
$\msVfy(\msCVK,\msMsg,\msCSig)$ unless all honest parties holding keys in
$\msVKL$ signed $m$.

Note that in the following, we make the parameter~$\msParams$ implicit and leave
out the $ver$ suffix for verification key such that $k = k^{ver}$ for better
readability.

\subsection{Extended UTxO}\label{sec:eutxo}
The Hydra Head protocol is specified to work on the so-called Extended UTxO (EUTxO) ledgers
like Cardano.

The basis for EUTxO is Bitcoin's UTxO ledger
model~\cite{formal-model-of-bitcoin-transactions,Zahnentferner18-UTxO}.
Intuitively, it arranges transactions in a directed acyclic graph, such as the
one in Figure~\ref{fig:utxo-graph}, where boxes represent transactions with
(red) inputs to the left and (black) outputs to the right. A dangling
(unconnected) output is an \emph{unspent transaction output (UTxO)} --- there
are two UTxOs in the figure.

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{figures/utxo-graph.pdf}
	\caption{Example of a plain UTxO graph}\label{fig:utxo-graph}
\end{figure}

The following paragraphs will give definitions of the UTxO model and it's
extension to support scripting (EUTxO) suitable for this Hydra Head protocol
specification. For a more detailed introduction to the EUTxO ledger model,
see~\cite{eutxo},~\cite{eutxo-2}~and~\cite{utxo-ma}.

\subsubsection{Values}

\begin{definition}[Values]
	Values are sets that keep track of how many units of which tokens of which
	currency are available. Given a finitely supported function $\mapsto$, that
	maps keys to monoids, a value is the set of such mappings over currencies
	(minting policy identifiers), over a mapping of token names $\mathsf{tok}$ to
	quantities $q$:
	\[
		\val \in \tyValue = (c : \tyBytes \mapsto (t : \tyBytes \mapsto q : \tyInteger))
	\]
	\noindent where addition of values is defined as $+$ and $\varnothing$ is the empty value.
\end{definition}

\todo{define shorthands}
% \noindent We define shorthands:
% \begin{itemize}
%   \item \(\{t_1, \ldots, t_n\} :: c\) for a list of positive single quantity tokens
%         \(\{c \mapsto \{t_1 \mapsto 1, \ldots, t_n \mapsto 1\}\}\) (to mint).
%   \item \({\{t_1, \ldots, t_n\}}^{-1} :: c\) for a list of negative single quantity tokens
%         \(\{c \mapsto \{t_1 \mapsto 1, \ldots, t_n \mapsto 1\}\}\) (to burn).
% \end{itemize}

For example, the value $\{c_{1} \mapsto \{t_1 \mapsto 1, t_2 \mapsto 1\}\}$
contains tokens $t_1$ and $t_2$ of currency $\mathsf{pid}$ and addition merges currencies
and token names naturally:
\begin{align*}
	     & \{c_{1} \mapsto \{t_1 \mapsto 1, t_2 \mapsto 1\}\}                                                        \\
	+ \  & \{c_{1} \mapsto \{t_{2} \mapsto 1, t_3 \mapsto 1\}, c_{2} \mapsto \{ t_{1} \mapsto 2\}\}                  \\
	= \  & \{c_{1} \mapsto \{t_1 \mapsto 1, t_2 \mapsto 2, t_3 \mapsto 1\}, c_{2} \mapsto \{ t_{1} \mapsto 2\}\} \ .
\end{align*}

While the above definition should be sufficient for the purpose of this
specification, a full treatment via finitely supported functions can be found
in~\cite{utxo-ma}.

\subsubsection{Scripts}

Validator scripts are called \emph{phase-2} scripts in the Cardano Ledger
specification (see~\cite{ledger-alonzo-spec} for a formal treatment of these). Scripts
are used for multiple purposes, but most often (and sufficient for this
specification) as a \emph{spending} or \emph{minting} policy script.

\begin{definition}[Minting Policy Script]
	A script $\mu \in \mathcal{M}$ governing whether a value can be minted (or
	burned), is a pure function with type
	\[
		\mu \in \mathcal{M} = (\rho : \tyData) \to (\txContext : \tyContext) \to\tyBool,
	\]
	where $\rho \in \tyData$ is the redeemer provided as part of the transaction
	being validated and $\txContext \in \tyContext$ is the validation
	context.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Spending Validator Script]
	A validator script $\nu \in \mathcal{V}$ governing whether an output can be
	spent, is a pure function with type
	\[
		\nu \in \mathcal{V} = (\delta : \tyData) \to (\rho : \tyData) \to (\txContext : \tyContext) \to\tyBool,
	\]
	where $\delta \in \tyData$ is the datum available at the output to be spent,
	$\rho \in \tyData$ is the redeemer data provided as part of the transaction
	being validated, and $\txContext \in \tyContext$ is the validation
	context.
\end{definition}

\subsubsection{Transactions}

We define EUTxO inputs, outputs and transactions as they are available to
scripts and just enough to specify the behavior of the Hydra validator scripts.
For example outputs addresses and datums are much more complicated in the full
ledger model~\cite{eutxo-2, ledger-shelley-spec}.

\begin{definition}[Outputs]
	An output $o \in \txOutputs$ stores some value $\val \in \tyValue$ at some address,
	defined by the hash of a validator script $\nu^{\#} \in \tyBytes = \hash(\nu \in \mathcal{V})$,
	and may store (reference) some data $\delta \in \tyData$:
	\[
		o \in \txOutputs = (\val : \tyValue \times \nu^{\#} : \tyBytes \times \delta : \tyData)
	\]
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Inputs]
	An input $i \in \txInputs$ is a reference to some output
	$\txOutRef \in \mathcal{R}$ and a corresponding redeemer $\rho \in \tyData$:
	\[
		i \in \txInputs = (\txOutRef : \mathcal{R} \times \rho : \tyData)
	\]
	where $\mathcal{R} = (\tyBytes \times \mathbb{N})$ references an output of a
	transaction by its id (that is, a hash of the transaction body) and the output
	index within that transaction.
\end{definition}

\todo{define transaction or context or both?}
\begin{definition}[Validation Context]
	A validation context $\txContext \in \tyContext$ is a view on the transaction
	to be validated:
	\[
		\txContext \in \tyContext = (\tyInputs \times \tyOutputs \times \tyValue \times \mathcal{S}^{\leftrightarrow} \times \mathcal{K})
	\]
	where $\txInputs \in \tyInputs$ is a \textbf{set} of inputs,
	$\txOutputs \in \tyOutputs$ is a \textbf{list} of outputs,
	$\txMint \in \tyValue$ is the minted (or burned) value,
	$(\txRmin, \txRmax) \in \mathcal{S}^{\leftrightarrow}$
	\todo{$\mathcal{S}^{\leftrightarrow}$ undefined, time \& periods instead?} are
	the lower and upper validity bounds where $\txRmin <= \txRmax$, and $\txKeys \in \mathcal{K}$ is the set
	of verification keys which signed the transaction.
\end{definition}

Informally, scripts are evaluated by the ledger when it applies a transaction to
its current state to yield a new ledger state (besides checking the transaction
integrity, signatures and ledger rules). Each validator script referenced by
an output is passed its arguments drawn from the output it locks and the
transaction context it is executed in. The transaction is valid if and only if
all scripts validate, i.e. $\mu(\rho, \txContext) = \true$ and
$\nu(\delta, \rho, \txContext) = \true$.

\subsection{State Machines}\label{sec:cem}

A convenient abstraction for EUTxO smart contracts spanning a sequence of
related transactions are state machines. This specification adopts and is
written using \emph{constraint emitting machines (CEMs)} from~\cite{eutxo}.
These are based on Mealy machines and consist of a set of states $\cemS$, a set
of inputs $\cemI$, a predicate \(\cemFinal : \cemS\to\tyBool\) identifying final
states, and a step relation \(\cemStepRel{s}{i}{s'}{\cemTxCon}\), which takes a
state $s$ on an input $i$ to a successor state $s'$ under the condition that the
constraints $\cemTxCon$ are satisfied.

CEMs are implemented on an EUTxO ledger by representing a sequence of CEM states
as a sequence of transactions. Each of these transactions has a
\emph{state-machine input} $\cemIn$ and a \emph{state-machine output} $\cemOut$,
where the latter is locked by a validator $\cemValidator$, implementing the step
relation. The only exceptions are the initial and final state, which have got no
state-machine input and output, respectively. More specifically, given two
transactions $\tx$ and $\tx'$, they represent successive states under
\(\cemStepRel{s}{i}{s'}{\cemTxCon}\) iff

\begin{mitemize}
	\item state-machine output $\cemOut = (\val, \cemValidator, \cemDatum)$
	describes starting state $\cemDatum = s$ and is consumed by $tx'$ via
	state-machine input $\cemIn' = (\txOutRef, \cemRedeemer)$, whose redeemer
	provides the state-machine input $\cemRedeemer = (i, \tilde{\redeemer})$ and
	\item either
	\begin{mitemize}
		\item $\cemFinal(s') = \true$ and $tx'$ has no state-machine output, or
		\item $\tx'$ meets all constraints imposed by $\cemTxCon$ and has output
		$\cemOut' = (\val', \cemValidator, \cemDatum')$ with the target state in
		the datum $\cemDatum' = s'$.
	\end{mitemize}
\end{mitemize}

Note that the state-machine validator $\cemValidator$ does check whether the
transition is possible and hence needs to be able to inspect the resulting state
$s'$ in $\cemDatum'$. In a Cardano transaction, that means that the actual output
datum needs to be included in the transaction (not just it's hash) or fully inlined
in the UTxO.

A CEM transition is represented graphically by two connected transactions as
shown in Figure~\ref{fig:state-transition}. The starting state of a transition
$s$ is given by the datum of $\cemOut$ of transaction $tx$ and depicted by the
left circle. Correspondingly, the end state $s'$ contained in the datum of
$\cemOut'$ of transaction $tx'$ in the right circle. The transition name $i$ and
additional data $\tilde \rho$ is shown above and below the transition arrow.
Fields $\val$ and $\val'$ are the value fields of the state-machine outputs,
while relevant fields of the transaction bodies are described by the rectangles
below.
